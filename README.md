# Under Construction
<br>

## Getting Started
- download the template files and put them into a `separate` folder for easy access

- open the `data` folder within your Lailloken UI installation and create a `new folder` with the name of your target language
- the chosen folder-name will be used/displayed in the settings menu:
  - in a dropdown-list used to switch between UI languages (if you choose to translate for that as well)
 
  - to show which client-language has been detected

- copy the template `client.txt` file into the folder you have created, then open it and read the instructions
  - you can start by adapting the keys tagged with `system_`, `contributor`, and `log_` to your target language first
 
  - once `log_enter` has been adapted, save the file and restart Lailloken UI
  - the `general` section of the settings menu should now show that the script has detected your client's language
 
- if the `client.txt` file has been fully adapted, the majority of item-related features will be usable in the target language

- anything beyond the `client.txt` is optional, and every file more or less corresponds with a specific area/feature within the tool
  - `important note:` don't dump every template-file into your project, only include those you actually translate/adapt (otherwise the tool will access outdated English template files)
 
- in order to translate the tool's own UI, the `UI.txt` file has to be translated
