;## purpose of this file
	;## the script uses this file to detect specific word patterns in data that was copied from the game-client in order to extract information
	;## these patterns used to be hard-coded for English only, but they are now exposed in this txt-file and can be adapted to new target languages


;## file structure
	;## the script ignores TABs, empty lines, as well as lines/sections marked as comments (;##)
	;## the file is divided into [sections]: don't change them unless stated otherwise
	;## each non-comment line in this file is a key/value pair, divided into two parts:
		;##	key		=	value
		;## some keys don't require a value


;## these keys are map-names as they are displayed at the top of map-items
;## these pairs are used to trim overly long names: if the key (partially) matches the item's name, the value will replace it
;## replace the keys with the corresponding in-game strings of the target language, then create a trimmed value

[Map Names]

;## map-mods will be grouped into these 5 categories
;## translate these keys as you see fit, but don't change the order

;## these are the different expedition groups/clans as they are displayed in the game, as well as the corresponding NPCs
;## replace both key and value with the corresponding strings of the target language

[expedition groups]

dried riverbed

karui wargraves
mountainside
rotting temple
sarn slums
scrublands
shipwreck reef
utzaal outskirts
vaal temple
volcanic island


;## from this point onwards, the [section] will be the strings of map-mods as they are displayed on map-items
;## replace those strings with the corresponding strings of the target language and use placeholders where applicable

;## each mod belongs to a type (from the five in the [mod types] section above)
;## there's a sixth "expedition" type: don't change that
;## you can simply use the "find & replace" feature in text-editors to quickly replace all the "type = X" lines (since there are only 5 different ones)

;## each mod has a short text-string that will be used in the map-info panel instead of the full mod-text
;## %-signs will be replaced by the actual %-roll of the map-mod, e.g. "ele reflect: %" -> "ele reflect: 15%"
;## try to trim down the text-strings as much as possible in order to keep the map-info panel compact

;## the text-strings between ID 200 and 300 make heavy use of abbreviations because the original mod-text is very long
